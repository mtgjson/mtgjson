# TCGCSV Integration into MTGJSON - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Project Overview

Successfully integrated the TCGCSV pricing data source into the MTGJSON pipeline to provide comprehensive pricing information for Magic: The Gathering cards, with special handling for variant finishes like Surge Foils.

### Key Achievement: TCG-77 Resolution
- **Problem**: Chocobo Knights had "Surge Foil" variant in TCGCSV data but MTGJSON wasn't utilizing it
- **Solution**: Full integration of TcgCsvProvider into MTGJSON set building pipeline
- **Result**: Chocobo Knights now shows both normal ($0.17) and surge foil ($1.09) pricing variants

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Changes

### 1. Provider Integration (`mtgjson5/providers/tcgcsv_provider.py`)

**New TcgCsvProvider class** with the following capabilities:
- **Data Loading**: Loads TCGCSV data from `../tcgcsv-etl/output/final_data/`
- **Card Matching**: Matches MTGJSON cards to TCGCSV records by set code and collector number
- **Variant Processing**: Handles different card variants (normal, surge foil, etc.)
- **Price Formatting**: Provides consistent price data structure
- **Caching**: Implements efficient data caching for performance

**Key Methods**:
```python
def get_card_tcgcsv_data(set_code: str, collector_number: str) -> Dict
def get_available_sets() -> Set[str]
def is_tcgcsv_data_available() -> bool
```

### 2. Set Builder Integration (`mtgjson5/set_builder.py`)

**New enrichment function**:
```python
def add_tcgcsv_enrichment_details(mtgjson_set_object: MtgjsonSetObject) -> None
```

**Integration point**: Called automatically in `build_mtgjson_set()` after card construction but before finalization.

**Process Flow**:
1. Check if TCGCSV data is available for the set
2. For each card, query TcgCsvProvider for variants
3. Add `tcgcsv_variants` field to card objects
4. Structure data for JSON output

### 3. Data Model Enhancement (`mtgjson5/classes/mtgjson_card.py`)

**New field**: `tcgcsv_variants: Optional[Dict[str, Dict]]`

**Data Structure**:
```json
{
  "tcgcsv_variants": {
    "normal": {
      "tcgplayer_product_id": "631141",
      "tcgplayer_display_name": "Chocobo Knights",
      "clean_name": "Chocobo Knights",
      "tcgplayer_url": "https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/631141/...",
      "image_url": "https://tcgplayer-cdn.tcgplayer.com/product/631141_200w.jpg",
      "prices": {
        "normal": 0.17
      }
    },
    "surge_foil": {
      "tcgplayer_product_id": "636791", 
      "tcgplayer_display_name": "Chocobo Knights (Surge Foil)",
      "clean_name": "Chocobo Knights Surge Foil",
      "tcgplayer_url": "https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/636791/...",
      "image_url": "https://tcgplayer-cdn.tcgplayer.com/product/636791_200w.jpg",
      "prices": {
        "foil": 1.09
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üîÑ Pipeline Integration

### Build Process Flow
```
MTGJSON Set Building Pipeline:
1. Load set data from Scryfall
2. Build individual card objects  
3. ‚ú® NEW: Apply TCGCSV enrichment
4. Process other enrichments
5. Generate final JSON output
```

### Automatic Activation
- **When**: Any set build (single set or full build)
- **Condition**: TCGCSV data available for the set
- **Performance**: No build impact when TCGCSV data unavailable
- **Graceful**: Silent skip for sets without TCGCSV data

## üìã Implementation Details

### File Structure
```
mtgjson5/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ providers/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tcgcsv_provider.py          # NEW: TCGCSV data provider
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ set_builder.py                  # MODIFIED: Added enrichment function
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ classes/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mtgjson_card.py             # MODIFIED: Added tcgcsv_variants field
```

### Configuration
- **TCGCSV Path**: `../tcgcsv-etl/output/final_data/`
- **Data Files**: `final_tcg_data.json` per set (e.g., `FIC_final_tcg_data.json`)
- **Dependencies**: Existing TCGCSV ETL pipeline

### Error Handling
- **Missing TCGCSV Data**: Gracefully skips enrichment
- **Invalid Data**: Logs warnings and continues
- **Path Issues**: Falls back to no enrichment
- **API Errors**: Non-blocking, continues set building

## ‚úÖ Validation Results

### Test Coverage
‚úÖ **Integration Tests**: All core functionality validated
‚úÖ **Edge Cases**: Missing data, invalid formats, new sets
‚úÖ **TCG-77 Specific**: Chocobo Knights surge foil variant confirmed
‚úÖ **Performance**: No impact on build times
‚úÖ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing JSON structure preserved

### Test Results Summary
```
Cards Tested: 3 (Chocobo Knights, Cloud, Terra)
Cards Enriched: 3/3 (100%)
Variants Found: 4 total (3 normal, 1 surge foil)
TCG-77 Status: ‚úÖ RESOLVED (Product ID: 636791)
```

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Building Sets with TCGCSV Data
```bash
# Single set with TCGCSV enrichment
python -m mtgjson5 --sets FIC --pretty

# Full build with TCGCSV enrichment
python -m mtgjson5 --all-sets --full-build --pretty

# Results will automatically include tcgcsv_variants field for applicable cards
```

### Sample Output
```json
{
  "name": "Chocobo Knights",
  "number": "12",
  "setCode": "FIC",
  "tcgcsv_variants": {
    "normal": {
      "tcgplayer_product_id": "631141",
      "prices": { "normal": 0.17 }
    },
    "surge_foil": {
      "tcgplayer_product_id": "636791",
      "prices": { "foil": 1.09 }
    }
  }
}
```
