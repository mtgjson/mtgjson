# About Us

MTGJSON is an open sourced database creation and distribution tool for [*Magic: The Gathering*](https://magic.wizards.com/) cards, specifically in [JSON](https://json.org/) format.

This repo contains our newest release, version 4. This version relies upon a variety of sources, such as *Scryfall* and *Gatherer* for our data.

You can find our documentation with all properties [here](https://mtgjson.com/v4/docs.html).

To provide feedback and/or bug reports, please [open a ticket](https://github.com/mtgjson/mtgjson4/issues/new/choose) as it is the best way for us to communicate with the public.

If you would like to join or assist the development of the project, you can [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/Hgyg7GJ) to discuss things further.

# How To Use

>**Note:** These are the build directions to compile your own JSON files.<br>
>If you are looking for pre-compiled JSON files, you can download them at [MTGJSON.com](https://mtgjson.com/v4).

This system was built using *Python 3.7*, so we can only guarantee proper functionality with this version.


1. First, you'll need to install the MTGJSON4 package and dependencies. You can do this via:

```sh
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Select the flag(s) you'd like to run the program with:

| Flags                       	| Flag Descriptions                                                                                                                              	|
|-----------------------------	|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| `-h`                        	| Print the help menu and exits.                                                                                                                 	|
| `-a`                        	| Build all sets. This overshadows the `-s` flag.                                                                                                	|
| `-s SET [SET ...]`          	| Build set code arguments, provided they exist.                                                                                                 	|
| `-c`                        	| After building any/all sets, create the compiled outputs (ex: AllSets, AllCards).                                                              	|
| `-x`                        	| Skips sets that have already been built (i.e. set files in the output folder), and build the remaining sets. Must be passed with `-a` or `-s`. 	|
| `--skip-tcgplayer`          	| If you don't have a TCGPlayer API key, you can disable building of TCGPlayer components.                                                       	|
| `--skip-sets SET [SET ...]` 	| Prevents set code arguments from being built, even if passed in via `-a` or `-s`.                                                              	|

3. Run the program, with any flag(s) you'd like, via:
```sh
usage: mtgjson4 [-h] [-a] [-s [SET [SET ...]]] [-c] [-x] [--skip-tcgplayer] [--skip-sets [SET [SET ...]]]
$ python3 -m mtgjson4
```
