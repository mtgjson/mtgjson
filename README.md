MTGJSON is an open-source repository of [Magic: The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/) card data, specifically in [JSON](https://json.org/) and [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) formats. This repository contains the build scripts we use to create our data sets.

## How to Use  
### For 99% of our Users  
MTGJSON supplies precompiled databases at https://mtgjson.com/api/v5/. **This is the recommended way to use our service**.  

As stated before, we pride ourselves on our documentation which can be found at https://mtgjson.com/. If you find anything to be unclear or ambiguous, please [open a ticket](https://github.com/mtgjson/mtgjson-website/issues) on our documentation repository so we can address your concern immediately.

We fully rebuild our API data once a week (on Monday afternoons) and our price dataset once a day. You can poll the [Meta.json](https://mtgjson.com/api/v5/Meta.json) file to see when our data was last updated.  

### For those who want to build MTGJSON locally  
Most of our users shouldn't have a need to build MTGJSON locally. However, there are always exceptions and we aren't ones to judge.  
#### Build Box
While MTGJSON will work on Windows, Mac, and Linux, we prefer working within the Linux environment for lower overheads and less manual dependency management.  

- For **Linux** based build boxes (we recommend Ubuntu 20.04), your build box should have at least 2 cores and 4 GiB of RAM available.  
- For **Mac** based build boxes, your build box should have at least 2 cores and 4 GiB of RAM available.
- For **Windows** based build boxes, your build box should have at least 4 cores and 8 GiB of RAM available.

#### Install Python3
MTGJSON is built on and tested against a wide range of Python3 versions. Currently, we maintain support for the following versions:
- Python 3.8
- Python 3.9
- Python 3.10
- Python 3.11
- Python 3.12

#### Install MTGJSON
##### Local Installation
`python3 -m pip install /path/to/mtgjson5/`
##### PyPi Repository
We intend to put MTGJSON5 on the pip package archive in the near future, once the first set of revisions takes place.

#### Using MTGJSON
A fully up-to-date help menu can be achieved via `python3 -m mtgjson5 -h`, but for your convenience here is a recent rundown:  
```
usage: mtgjson5 [-h] [-s [SET [SET ...]] | -a] [-c] [-x] [-z] [-p]
                [-SS [SET [SET ...]]] [-PB] [-R] [-NA]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s [SET [SET ...]], --sets [SET [SET ...]]
                        Set(s) to build, using Scryfall set code notation.
                        Non-existent sets silently ignored.
  -a, --all-sets        Build all possible sets, overriding the --sets option.
  -c, --full-build      Build new prices, MTGSQLive, and compiled outputs like
                        AllPrintings.
  -x, --resume-build    While determining what sets to build, ignore
                        individual set files found in the output directory.
  -z, --compress        Compress the output folder's contents for
                        distribution.
  -p, --pretty          When dumping JSON files, prettify the contents instead
                        of minifying them.
  -SS [SET [SET ...]], --skip-sets [SET [SET ...]]
                        Purposely exclude sets from the build that may have
                        been set using --sets or --all-sets.

mtgjson maintainer arguments:
  -PB, --price-build    Build updated pricing data then exit.
  -R, --referrals       Create and maintain a referral map for referral
                        linkages.
  -NA, --no-alerts      Prevent push notifications from sending when property
                        keys are defined.
```

#### MTGJSON Environment Variables
Due to how the new system is built, a few advanced values can be set by the user in the shell environment.
- `MTGJSON5_DEBUG` When set to 1 or true, additional logging will be dumped to the output files
- `MTGJSON5_OUTPUT_PATH` When set, MTGJSON will dump all outputs to a specific directory
    - Ex:  `MTGJSON5_OUTPUT_PATH=~/Desktop` will dump database files to `/home/USER/Desktop/mtgjson_build_5XXX` and log files to `/home/USER/Desktop/logs`
