Otherwise, a 5/5 flying Djinn immediately comes into play on your side. Use a counter to represent Djinn. Djinn is treated exactly like a normal artifact creature except that if it leaves play it is removed from the game entirely. No matter how the flip turns out, Bottle of Suleiman is discarded after use."
